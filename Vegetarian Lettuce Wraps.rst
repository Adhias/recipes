Instructions
------------

#. In a small bowl, stir together the hoisin, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Set aside.
#. Press the tofu between paper towels to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Refresh the paper towels and press again. Heat the 2 teaspoons canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high.

   - Once the oil is hot, crumble in the tofu, breaking it into very small pieces as it cooks.
   - Continue cooking for 5 minutes, then add the diced mushrooms.
   - Continue cooking until any remaining tofu liquid cooks off and the tofu starts to turn golden, about 3 minutes more.
   - Stir in the water chestnuts, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and half of the green onions and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds more.

#. Pour the sauce over the top of the tofu mixture and stir to coat. Cook just until you hear bubbling and the sauce is warmed through, 30 to 60 seconds.
#. Spoon the tofu mixture into individual lettuce leaves. Top with remaining green onions, grated carrots, and additional red pepper flakes as desired. Enjoy immediately.
